== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= Do I need a Google Ads account? =
 
Yes, you should have your own account. You need a Google Ads account so that we can upload your ads and track important metrics needed for optimization and improvement. You can refer to the following link for an instructional video on how to make your account: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWB1Ig3DYkE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWB1Ig3DYkE)
 
= Do I need collections? =
 
If you do not have collections/categories and do not wish to include them on your web page, you can give the app permission to create hidden categories to allow us to help structure your campaign.

= Which languages are you able to create campaigns in? =

We are currently able to create Google Ads campaigns in English, Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese.

= How much time do you need to create my campaigns? =

It will take our team less than 5 minutes to configure and then about 48 hours to process and review the campaign. Campaigns will pass through review and quality control by one of our Google Ads account managers, which should take less than 48 hours.

= Is it free? =

Our Basic subscription is free! However, we have Premium and Custom plans that allow users to do even more with their Google Ads. Take a look at this link to see all the features that come with each plan: [https://www.cleverecommerce.com/pricing/](https://www.cleverecommerce.com/pricing/)

= I have multiple shops, should I create multiple Google Ads accounts? =

Definitely. This way you can have separate metrics for each shop and it will be much easier for you to gather performance information about each one.

= How do I know when my campaigns are ready? =

You will receive an email confirming your campaigns have been uploaded to your Google Ads account. This email will also contain the banners we have created for your display campaigns, general information about your campaigns and a Word Cloud with the keywords used to create your campaigns.

= How much should I spend on Google Ads? =

We typically recommend a minimum budget of $15 a day. The amount of times your ads will be displayed is based on how much you decide to spend each day. So, if you have a low budget, your ads will be displayed less, and, therefore, reach a small amount of potential clients. This decreases your chances of receiving impressions, clicks, and most importantly, conversions. If you want more information on how much to spend on Google Ads, you can refer to the following link: [https://www.cleverecommerce.com/how-much-should-i-spend-on-adwords/](https://www.cleverecommerce.com/how-much-should-i-spend-on-adwords/)

= What happens if I include more products/collections after creation? =
 
Creating new ads for new products and collections is a feature of our Premium plan. Premium users can contact their personal account manager about their new products or collections and they will update your ads to fit these products.
